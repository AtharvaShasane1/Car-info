          Cars are an essential mode of transportation used for leisure
          activities, work, or travelling purposes. Each new model of a car and
          its specific feature can determine its driving experience. Cars can be
          a safe way to commute to avoid close contact with the general public
          during pandemic situations. A car at home can be very beneficial in
          case of family health emergencies. Cars offer the flexibility of
          travel and help to maintain punctuality. In the early days of the
          automobile, there were just a handful of companies that were itching
          to grow. Today, however, there are 14 major global corporations that
          control more than 60 major automotive brands across the globe, and
          that doesn't even count the smaller local companies in various
          countries around the world. This page is your portal to each and every
          automaker from Mazda to Chevy, Suzuki, and even some exotic brands
          like McLaren and Lamborghini.
